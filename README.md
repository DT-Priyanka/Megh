DataTorrent Operator library for Apache Apex
============================================

This repository contains open source operator and codec library that can be used with the [Apache Apex](http://apex.apache.org/) platform to build streaming applications.

Operators from this repository will be gradually migrated to [Apache Apex Malhar](https://github.com/apache/apex-malhar). Some of the operators already have a replacement there. Please see http://apex.apache.org/contributing.html on how to get involved.
